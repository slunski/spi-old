This is Simple Perl6 Installer. It is for:

- downloading Parrot and Rakudo sources from repositories
- installing Parrot VM
- install Rakudo Perl6 implementation

Parrot version checkouted from repo is always suitable for building Rakudo or
newest with 'make just-parrot' target.

Parrot installs everything system wide by default or into Rakudo source directory (eg. for
Perl6 (Rakudo) testing) with 'make fast' target.

Rakudo is installed into Parrot.

USAGE

1)

You need to configure SDIR and IDIR varibles at top of Makefile file.

SDIR is directory where you want to download sources and where everything will be
compiled. By default it is /usr/src.

IDIR is place where everything will be installed, by default it is /usr/local.

make parrot-get
make rakudo-get

make parrot-build
make rakudo-build

3)

make parrot-install
make rakudo-install
