This is (S)imple (P)erl6 (I)nstaller.

It has form of single Makefile file and was written to assist in building and system
wide installing Parrot and Rakudo projects. In truth, it is just basic adapter for
Parrot and Rakudo build system.

Currently it allows to:

- download Parrot and Rakudo sources from repositories
- build and install
- test
- helps in:
	- automatical building packages, eg. .deb, .rpm, .tgz (with checkinstall)
	- getting list of installed files (with installwatch) 

Parrot version checkouted from repo is suitable for building Rakudo or
newest with 'just-parrot' target.

Parrot installs everything system wide by default or into Rakudo source directory (eg. for
Rakudo Perl6 implementation testing) with 'fast' target.

Rakudo is installed into Parrot install location.

INSTALATION

Place Makefile somewhere and configure SDIR and IDIR varibles at top of the file.

- SDIR is directory where download sources will be located and where everything
	will be compiled. By default it is /usr/src.

- IDIR is place where everything will be installed, by default it is /usr/local.

USAGE

1)

make all
	Gets and builds Parrot and Rakudo

make parrot
	Gets and builds Parrot version suitable for building Rakudo

make just-parrot
	Gets and builds Parrot, newest version (HEAD)

make rakudo
	Gets and builds Rakudo, master branch. Assume Parrot was build in SDIR

make fast
	Gets and builds Rakudo, master branch. Before building it gets, builds and
	installs Parrot into Rakudo subdirs then build Rakudo using that Parrot. Not
	adequate for system wide installation.

make parrot-get
make rakudo-get
	Gets both, Parrot and Rakudo respectively

make parrot-build
make rakudo-build
	Builds Parrot and Rakudo respectively

2)

make install
make parrot-install
make rakudo-install
	Installs both, Parrot and Rakudo respectively into IDIR.

For automatic packages building (eg. installwatch/checkinstall) see below.

3)

make wipe
make parrot-wipe
make rakudo-wipe
	Removes both, Parrot and Rakudo respectively from SDIR.
